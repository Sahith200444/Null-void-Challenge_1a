All questions and responses will be shared with those who have indicated that they will be submitting a proposal. Please note, that firms/consultants who have not indicated in an e-mail to Michael Ridley by April 11 that they will be submitting a proposal will not receive any further information or question responses. First, some background on the ODL. For the last two years the Ontario Library Association has acted as a catalyst, bringing together the stakeholders needed to create the Ontario Digital Library (ODL). These stakeholders include Ontario’s 5000+ public libraries, university, college, and school libraries, as well as Ontario government ministries. Libraries that serve very different clientele recognize that by working together they can create seamless access to quality electronic library services. Through the ODL, students will be able to explore a topic at school, use the same child-safe resources after school (either at electronic resources that are still available and then, after graduation, continue to use these skills and resources at work or at home. commercial products as individual libraries or institutions. We can work together to spend our money wisely. The provincial government has made this possible by working hard to provide all Ontarians with a stable, high-speed communications infrastructure. While there is still a best to exploit communications technology. We can reduce barriers to access and create the content infrastructure needed to support a knowledge society. envision and attain Ontario’s economic goal prepared by the Ontario Jobs and Investment Board. The OJIB strategic plan recommends an electronic library to “connect students to new that and much more. The ODL will connect students to electronic information, and will also leverage this investment to help connect all citizens to the electronic information they need as Libraries have long been a key delivery point for public services. The ODL will allow that rooms. Jurisdiction-wide digital libraries are very practical and very real. The ODL we propose is leading edge for Ontario but several jurisdictions have forged the path with collaborative digital libraries. We can learn from their experiences. For example, The Alberta Library (TAL)"

Many others, particularly in rural regions, do not.

This plan will clearly define the ODL’s services, funding and governance structures, as well as implementation plans for 2003-2005. It will also secure consultative approach. To ensure that the planning results in a workable plan with the full commitment communication components so critical in a consultative process. Phase II: Implementing and Transitioning Timeline: April 2004 – Dec ember 2006 Funding Request ed: Funding from other states and provinces suggest that the ODL could receive stakeholders and other interested parties. Result: The ODL is implemented and validated The second phase will be to implement the ODL based on the business plan. This phase recognizes providing services. The transition must occur while libraries continue to provide existing services and library stakeholders and other interested parties as a means to quickly jumpstart the ODL. The seed money requested will allow libraries to realign their budgets and services as the infrastructure recommendations . During this phase the polices, procedures, governance structures and accountability Information resources will be identified, contracts for these resources will be negotiated and resources will be made deployed through the ODL. Regular evaluation during this phase will ensure the ODL is achieving its objectives and is accountable to its key communities. Phase III: Operating and Growing the ODL Timeline: January 2007 - Funding: $50 Mi llion annually ($35 Million requested from government) Result: The O DL is fully operational and sustainable In the third phase the ODL moves into the operational stage. Ontarians will experience the full benefits"

All participants (i.e. beneficiaries) are ODL on Ontario’s economy, society and learning support that all library sectors are participants (university, colleges, public libraries and schools). The propos ed funding model requires a continuing government investment, but also recognizes that as sources. During the 3-year implementation phase (2004 – 2006) libraries will realign their budgets to enable ongoing funding contributions to ODL. During the same period ODL must build the proposed endowment and secure public and private sector gifts and/or in-kind contributions. The following chart outlines the model. This model is based on these assumptions: 1. that ODL expenditures will increase by 50% over a 10 year period 2. that government funding will decrease from 70% to 45% during that 10 year period 3. that library contributions, endowment and gifts/in-kind funding will increase from 30% to 55% during the same period Government $35M (70%) $33.75M (45%) Libraries $10M (20%) $22.5M (30%) Endowment $4.5M (9%) $15M (20%) Gifts/In-Kind $0.5M (1%) $3.75M (5%) TOTAL ANNUAL $50M $75M While the private sector will be invited to participate in the ODL through the endowment, gifts and in- kind contributions, the ODL will also explore compatible commercial services which leverage the reach It is important to recognize that every new dollar per citizen invested in the Ontario Digital Library has a strengthens every local library in Ontario by allowing them to reinvest existing dollars in new resources that enhance local services.
